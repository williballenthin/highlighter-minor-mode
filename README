highlighter-minor-mode

highlighter-minor-mode is an Emacs minor mode to assist with log analysis. It
brings many features from Mandiant Highlighter 
<http://www.mandiant.com/products/free_software/highlighter/> to Emacs.  This is 
particularly relevant to Linux users, who may find it difficult to run the .NET
Highlighter binary.


highlighter-minor-mode accepts four input types:

  type               shortcut
  -------------      --------
  regex pattern      p
  fixed string       t
  current word       w
  selection          s


Three operations can be applied to each input type:

  operation          shortcut
  ----------         --------
  include-           i
  exclude-           x
  highlight-         h


highlighter-minor-mode operations are prefixed with hl-mode-. You can build each
supported function by concatenating the prefix, operation, and input type. For
example, 

  To include lines that contain the current word:
  hl-mode-include-word

  To remove lines that contain the current selection:
  hl-mode-exclude-selection


highlighter-minor-mode keybindings follow the form: 

  C-hC-lC-<op. shortcut>C-<in. shortcut>
    ^  ^
    |  |
    +--+-- (HighLighter)

For example,

  To include lines that contain the current word:
  C-hC-lC-iC-w

  To remove lines that contain the current selection:
  C-hC-lC-xC-s


All highlights can be removed using hl-mode-highlight-clear, or C-hC-lC-c.


highlighter-minor-mode saves a temporary file when you enter the minor mode, and
restores the file when you exit the mode.  This way, you don't have to worry 
about destructive edits.
